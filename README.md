# Go testing examples
Some test writing examples in **Golang**.

☝️ Every folder contains a different testing methods using standard libraries, convey and fuzz testing.

👉 We tried to keep it as simple as possible to make the logic behind the test as clear as possible.

-----

## How to run test:
- checkout selected folder e.g. `$ cd compare`
- create `go.mod` 💡
    - `$ go mod init example.com/m` to initialize a v0 or v1 module
    - `$ go mod tidy` to create go.mod file
- finally, run the test by `$ go test` ✅

## Check test coverage:
if you want to double-check if your cover 100% or not
- run `$ go test -cover` 😎
